      <p>Stress is a natural part of life, but chronic stress can negatively impact your mental and physical health. Learning effective strategies to manage it is crucial for well-being.</p>
      <h3>1. Practice Mindfulness and Meditation</h3>
      <p>Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment. Even a few minutes of meditation or deep breathing exercises daily can reduce stress levels. Apps like Calm or Headspace can guide you.</p>
      <h3>2. Regular Physical Activity</h3>
      <p>Exercise is a powerful stress reliever. It helps produce endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week.</p>
      <h3>3. Prioritize Sleep</h3>
      <p>Lack of sleep can exacerbate stress. Ensure you're getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Establish a regular sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine.</p>
      <h3>4. Healthy Diet</h3>
      <p>What you eat can affect your mood and energy levels. Opt for a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit caffeine and processed foods, which can worsen anxiety.</p>
      <h3>5. Connect with Others</h3>
      <p>Social support is vital. Spend time with loved ones, talk about your feelings, or join a support group. Feeling connected can significantly reduce feelings of isolation and stress.</p>
      <p>Remember, managing stress is an ongoing process. Be patient with yourself and seek professional help if stress becomes overwhelming.</p>

    fullContent: `
      <p>Self-esteem is your overall opinion of yourself â€“ how you feel about your abilities and limitations. High self-esteem isn't about being arrogant; it's about having a realistic, appreciative opinion of yourself.</p>
      <h3>1. Identify and Challenge Negative Thoughts</h3>
      <p>Our thoughts profoundly impact our self-esteem. When you catch yourself thinking negatively about yourself, challenge those thoughts. Ask if they are truly accurate or just a habit.</p>
      <h3>2. Focus on Your Strengths</h3>
      <p>Make a list of your positive qualities and accomplishments. Acknowledge your talents and successes, no matter how small they seem. Regularly remind yourself of what you're good at.</p>
      <h3>3. Set Realistic Goals</h3>
      <p>Achieving goals can boost your self-esteem. Start with small, attainable goals and gradually work your way up. Celebrate each success along the way.</p>
      <h3>4. Practice Self-Compassion</h3>
      <p>Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a good friend. Avoid self-criticism and forgive yourself for mistakes.</p>
      <h3>5. Engage in Activities You Enjoy</h3>
      <p>Doing things you love can make you feel more capable and connected. Hobbies, creative pursuits, or learning new skills can significantly improve your self-perception.</p>
      <p>Building self-esteem takes time and effort. Be persistent, celebrate small victories, and consider professional guidance if you struggle significantly.</p>
